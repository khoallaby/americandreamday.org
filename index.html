                    <p>An overwhelming three out of four American adults believe it is harder to get ahead today than it was in the past, and less than one-fourth expect that their children will have more opportunities to advance than they have (source: Allstate/Atlantic Media).</p>
                    <p>This is a major challenge that we must rise to as a nation. Unfortunately, at the same time that many have felt the American Dream dimming, our sense of common purpose as a nation has waned as well. Divisiveness and polarization are at an all-time high.</p>
                    <p>This tearing of our social fabric and the distrust it fosters is one of the greatest threats we face. This division holds us back from coming up with win/win solutions that move us forward as a Nation, restore the middle class, and keep the American Dream strong for generations to come.</p>
